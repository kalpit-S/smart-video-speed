## Possible future updates
- Chrome extension (will do this very soon)

- Upload to Firefox Add-ons and Chrome Web store

- User-Defined Shortcuts: Allow users to set custom shortcuts

- Music Video Exclusion: Exclude music videos from getting affected by default speed settings

- Enhanced Transcript Analysis: The extension could analyze the upcoming transcript from that point to determine the speaker's pace and adjust the video speed accordingly, allowing for more localized control.

- Context-Sensitive Speed Adjustment: For example, if a video has complex math, then it probably shouldn't be sped up as much as other videos
